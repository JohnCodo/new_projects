Rear Window Heater


SYR_BCU19_HT_187 :
Timeout_Klima--- is provided by Gateway module, but one remark here "The timeout is not made on Klima16,it's made on Klima12 ,
 because this will be the fastest message in the ECU"
Voltage_out_of_range--- is a internal interface provided by Voltage Manager module. I think this range is between 8V-16V(need to check tomorrow)?
HSH_Relais_Anf_can1 this is a CAN signal from Klima16 message and is sent by ICAS ECU.
o_Heckscheibenheizung_EIN --- this is the output HW , the relay on the car's rear window.
The pin HW is a low side , means with short circuit to plus we have an OverLoad
cs_rear_window_heater_is_act --- a internal interface between RWH Application and Power Mode module

SYR_BCU19_HT_187 :
o_HSH_Status_can is a CAN signal on the BCM05 message, where we save the status for the hzg output HW
SYR_BCU19_HT_224:
the status of the activation is not saved in NVM memory.
SYR_BCU19_HT_241: The routine starts from Diagnosis panel with the command : 31 01 0492 and 4 parameters with 3 bytes size.
 In the first byte we have: pulse duration and number of pulses. In the second byte we have max deviation in Volt
 and in the third byte we have specify target value
When the routine is started the APP should provide to the Diagnosis module the last consumption calculated value. 
This value is saved in a messwerte block with ID 08A1.
If the value calculated is smaller than specify target value the APP  returns to Diagnosis module incorrect result.
And correct result if the value is greater.

31 02 0492 without any parameters
31 03 and ID of routine
